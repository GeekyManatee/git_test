    <p>I'm currently writing a paragraph in VSC. We're practicing line breaks because normally</p>

    <p>The extra spaces wouldn't be parased and all the text would be squished together</p>

    <h1>This is a heading!</h1>
    <h4>But this is a much smaller heading :O</h4>

    <p>That's such a <strong>bold</strong> statement</p>

    <p>That's one <em>spicy</em> meatball!</p>

    <!-- Wow, it's a comment within the code -->
    <!-- Make sure to use <strong> and <em> instead of <b> and <i> due to accessibility -->
